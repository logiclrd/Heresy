# Recursive Pattern/Sequence sound sources

This document records the *first executable slice* of recursive playback and
the contracts still outstanding. The tracked requirements are in
[docs/todo.md](todo.md); this file does not mark them completed.

## Original musical model

Patterns and sequences are sources just as samples, instruments and FM synths
are. A nested invocation can be **flattened** into the parent's sequencing
context or can be a **mixdown** whose children render into one parent voice
while preserving the configured multichannel speaker feeds. Channel-state
scope, pitch/speed, Note Off, release tails, random/effect memory and
source-frame seeking must be deterministic for each invocation. A recursive
reference must be safely rejected or bounded.

This is **not** the same distinction as mono versus stereo: a mixed-down
nested source can still output stereo, 5.1 or another speaker configuration.

## First executable slice (October 8, 2026)

- The playback snapshot resolver now keys its sound cache by **(ObjectId,
  Mixdown)** rather than ObjectId alone; a source may eventually have distinct
  flattened/mixdown representations.
- For a Pattern or Sequence requested as `Mixdown: true`, the resolver uses the
  existing common data/script schedule compiler and returns a
  `CompiledNestedMixdownSound`. Each started note creates independent
  `PlaybackSession` state and renders directly into the parent's configured
  interleaved output channels. It does not eagerly cook an entire PCM buffer.
- Offset seeking is reported as `ReplayRequired`; its native source-frame
  offset is reached by deterministically replaying the child schedule from
  frame zero. Seeking backwards also recreates/replays the session.
- At the compiled logical end the child session receives `EndInput`, followed
  by the same indefinite-voice cleanup policy used by offline output; finite
  tails are allowed to continue. A rendered instance stops after quiescence.
- Active per-thread nested render object IDs reject cyclic invocation paths
  instead of infinitely recursing through `PlaybackSession.Render`.
- Integration tests start nested data Patterns and Sequences as sources from
  outer data Patterns, and check audible PCM using the actual snapshot
  playback source factory. Further tests cover native source-frame offsets,
  multiple independent nested invocations and cycle protection.

## Boundaries deliberately NOT complete

- Ordinary `Mixdown: false` nested Pattern/Sequence notes **still do not
  resolve**. Flattening cannot be implemented merely by wrapping a child
  `PlaybackSession`: it must map child physical/virtual channels into the
  parent's sequencing context and correctly scope parent tempo/effect memory.
- The first mixdown implementation supports unit initial pitch/speed only. It
  **rejects** other initial pitch/playback-speed multipliers rather than playing
  incorrect audio. Child pitch trajectory/time-warp and parent row-time
  effects need a precise mapping.
- An early parent Note Off currently bounds the mixdown voice; fully
  propagating Note Off into active nested child voices and allowing their
  individual finite releases is unfinished.
- Scripted children, nested reference graph expansion and sound compilation
  should eventually be **prepared outside the realtime audio callback**.
  The present on-demand resolver path does not yet guarantee that; avoid
  relying on expensive scripted nested sources for realtime smoothness.
- ReplayRequired source seeking is correct for the supported unit-speed
  private-session slice, but mixing/flattening, pitch transforms, more complex
  effects and source timing need broader tests and implementation.
- Cyclic scheduled/rendered source graphs have a render-time cycle guard, but
  a full structural/cost/resource policy remains open.

Continue red-test-first, preserving the existing sample/instrument/FM
renderers and avoiding duplicate sequencing semantics in a separate engine.
